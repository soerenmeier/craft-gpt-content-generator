# GPT Content Generator for Craft CMS

## Overview
GPT Content Generator is a dynamic plugin designed for Craft CMS 4. It integrates advanced GPT capabilities into your CMS, enabling the creation, enhancement, and translation of text content with ease.

## Key Features

**GPT-Powered Prompts**: Utilize GPT technology to process and respond to prompts within text fields. These prompts are built using Twig templates, which allow access to various site-specific details like language settings, field instructions, and labels.

**Prompt Organization and Access Control**: To streamline content management and enhance security, prompts can be organized into groups. Each field can be associated with a specific prompt group, ensuring a structured and efficient workflow. Importantly, each group is equipped with its own set of permissions, allowing you to control who can view and edit the prompts.
